# OpenCV Collections

Welcome to the **OpenCV Collections** repository! This repository features various OpenCV-based projects that showcase computer vision techniques and applications. The projects are designed to be beginner-friendly and offer practical implementations using OpenCV and other helpful libraries like MediaPipe.

## ðŸ“‚ Projects in This Collection

1. **Autonomous Drone Vision System (Simple Version)**  
   A simple, webcam-based project that simulates a drone's vision system by detecting human faces in real-time using OpenCV. This project showcases how to implement face detection and basic simulated drone movements.
   
2. **Hand Gesture Detection using OpenCV and MediaPipe**  
   A real-time hand gesture detection system using OpenCV and MediaPipe. The program detects hand landmarks to recognize basic hand gestures like open hands and fists.
   
3. **Virtual Try-On Glasses using OpenCV**  
   A webcam-based virtual try-on system that detects facial landmarks using MediaPipe and overlays a transparent glasses image onto the user's face. It simulates how glasses would look on the user's face in real-time.

## ðŸ§  How It Works

- **Autonomous Drone Vision System:**  
  Uses OpenCV to detect human faces from the webcam feed. The project simulates a drone's behavior based on face detection (hovering or moving toward detected faces).

- **Hand Gesture Detection:**  
  Uses MediaPipe to track hand landmarks and OpenCV to detect simple gestures like open hands and fists, displaying the results on the webcam feed in real-time.

- **Virtual Try-On Glasses:**  
  Detects facial landmarks using MediaPipe and overlays a transparent glasses image over the eyes to simulate how the glasses would look on the userâ€™s face.

## ðŸ”® Future Improvements

Each project has potential for further development. Some ideas include:

- Adding more advanced gesture recognition.
- Incorporating multi-hand or multi-face detection.
- Implementing obstacle avoidance for the drone vision system.
- Allowing users to try on different glasses styles in the virtual try-on project.
